## Problem Statement
### Combating Fake Reviews and Enhancing Product Recommendations in E-Commerce
Fake reviews distort product perceptions and undermine trust in e-commerce. This project uses advanced machine learning and sentiment analysis to detect deceptive reviews through linguistic patterns, sentiment anomalies, and user behavior analysis. By integrating authentic reviews, our system improves personalized product recommendations. The result is a reliable framework that reduces the impact of fake reviews and enhances recommendation accuracy, fostering a trustworthy and user-centric online shopping experience.

## Solution Analysis
Our project leverages advanced techniques to address fake reviews and enhance product recommendations effectively. We use the Cassandra database for faster retrieval of large volumes of review data, ensuring real-time processing and scalability. To classify fake reviews, we implement machine learning models such as NLP, TextBlob and RegularExpression, which analyze linguistic patterns and sentiment anomalies. For product recommendations, we utilize user-based collaborative filtering, which examines user behaviors and preferences to provide personalized suggestions. These integrated approaches collectively enhance the detection of fake reviews and improve the accuracy of product recommendations, fostering a trustworthy and user-centric online shopping experience.
